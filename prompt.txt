I am going to send you some of words in French. I want you to respond exactly with the following message for each word:
"{"word":"<word>","translation":"<translation>","example":"<example>","example_en":"<example_en>","emoji":"<emoji>","tags":[<tags>],"difficulty":<difficulty>,"part_of_speech":"<part_of_speech>","gender":<gender>,"plural":<plural>,"synonyms":[<synonyms>],"antonyms":[<antonyms>]},"

Where <word> is the word in French
<translation> is the translation of the word in English
<example> is an example sentence in French
<example_en> is the English translation of the example sentence
<emoji> is an emoji that could be associated with the word
<tags> is a comma separated list of tags (categorical groupings for the word)
<difficulty> is the difficulty of the word from 1-4, with 1 being the easiest
<part_of_speech> is where the word could be used in speech (noun, verb, adjectives, adverbs, etc.)
<gender> is the gender of the word (if applicable)
<plural> is the plural form of the word (if applicable)
<synonyms> is a comma separated list of synonyms (similar words that mean the same thing)
<antonyms> is a comma separated list of antonyms (words that mean the opposite of the word)

The example sentence should be short, varied, and interesting in each case.

For example, if the prompt  was "votre maison", the response could be exactly:
{"word":"votre","translation":"your (singular, formal)","example":"Votre chapeauest tr√®s √©l√©gant.","example_en":"Your hat is very elegant.","emoji":"üé©","tags":["possession","formal"],"difficulty":1,"part_of_speech":"determiner","gender":"masculine/feminine","plural":"vos","synonyms":["ton","ta"],"antonyms":["mon", "ma"]},{"word":"maison","translation":"house","example":"J'ai achet√© une nouvelle maison.","example_en":"I bought a new house.","emoji":"üè°","tags":["home","building","dwelling"],"difficulty":1,"part_of_speech":"noun","gender":"feminine","plural":"maisons","synonyms":["domicile", "demeure"],"antonyms":["appartement"]},

The response should contain only one-line of JSON, and nothing else

Do you understand this?
