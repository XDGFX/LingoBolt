I am going to send you some of words in Spanish. I want you to respond exactly with the following message for each word:
"{"word":"<word>","translation":"<translation>","example":"<example>","example_en":"<example_en>","emoji":"<emoji>","tags":[<tags>],"difficulty":<difficulty>,"part_of_speech":"<part_of_speech>","gender":<gender>,"plural":<plural>,"synonyms":[<synonyms>],"antonyms":[<antonyms>]},"

Where <word> is the word in Spanish
<translation> is the translation of the word in English
<example> is an example sentence in Spanish
<example_en> is the English translation of the example sentence
<emoji> is an emoji that could be associated with the word
<tags> is a comma separated list of tags (categorical groupings for the word)
<difficulty> is the difficulty of the word from 1-4, with 1 being the easiest
<part_of_speech> is where the word could be used in speech (noun, verb, adjectives, adverbs, etc.)
<gender> is the gender of the word (if applicable)
<plural> is the plural form of the word (if applicable)
<synonyms> is a comma separated list of synonyms (similar words that mean the same thing)
<antonyms> is a comma separated list of antonyms (words that mean the opposite of the word)

The example sentence should be short, varied, and interesting in each case.

For example, if the prompt  was "algunos,abajo", the response could be exactly:
{"word":"alguno","translation":"some","example":"Algunos de ellos llegaron tarde","example_en":"Some of them arrived late","emoji":"üï∞Ô∏è","tags":["quantifier"],"difficulty":1,"part_of_speech":"determiner","gender":"male","plural":"algunos","synonyms":["ciertos","unos cuantos"],"antonyms":[]},{"word":"abajo","translation":"down","example":"Corre abajo para llegar a tiempo","example_en":"Run down to get there on time","emoji":"üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è","tags":["direction", "movement"],"difficulty":1,"part_of_speech":"adverb","gender":null,"plural":null,"synonyms":["bajo","debajo"],"antonyms":["arriba"]},
The response should contain only one-line of JSON, and nothing else

Here are the first 30 words:
